This is a raytracer that was written by me, during one semester.
My raytracer is built to render a scene that includes polygonal models, spheres, textures, multiple light sources, and even reflection and refraction.

It is written in Java and utilizes a few external libraries, written by other people, which are in the 'lib' folder.

The 'Drivers' folder contains some test files for running the raytracer. The results of these files are in the 'Results' folder.
